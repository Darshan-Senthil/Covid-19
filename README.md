Visualizing the number of confirmed, recovered, deaths of COVID 19 cases worldwide and also classified them as Countrywise, state, Age, Gender, etc. And also finding out some meaningful insights by using several datasets. 

> In this project, I have collected, cleaned and visualized the datasets for clear and easy understanding. 
> Furthermore, I have figure out the Top 10 countries and Top 10 states of India which is highly affect by the novel coronavirus. Also, I have done the time series analysis of the Confirmed, Death and recovered cases across the world from February to May 2019.
